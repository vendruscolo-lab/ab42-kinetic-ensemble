# A kinetic ensemble of the Alzheimer's Aβ peptide

This repository contains all the trajectories, intermediate data, and code to reproduce the results. The structure is as follows:

### Directories
- `trajectories/`: The simulations trajectories, subsampled to 250 ps timesteps, performed in 5 rounds with 1024 individual trajectories each. The aggregated simulated time is 314 µs. Also includes the chemcial shifts backcalculated with *CamShift* as implemented in Plumed.
- `intermediate/`: Intermediate data files, such as the calculated inter-residue minimum distances, and the full model outputs in the form of transition matrices, weights, and timescales.
- `models/`: The neural network models including weights and trajectory indices used for training.
- `structures{,-alt}/`: State structures sampled from the trajectories.
- `figs/`: Raw figures for the paper, generated by the notebooks.

### Notebooks
- `msm-vampe-hyperpar.ipynb`: Hyperparameter search code, can be run with `papermill`.
- `msm-vampe-training.ipynb`: Training code, can be run with `papermill`.
- `msm-vampe-model-analysis.ipynb`: Simple post-processing of the trained models, includes calculation of the CK-test and the implied timescales.
- `msm-vampe-analysis.ipynb`: Full analysis and plots of the ensemble.
- `model.py`: The neural network model code.
